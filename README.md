# horiseon-code-refactor

Description:
    The goal was to refactor the code in the CSS and HTML to have it more detailed.
    I updated the basic Semantic elements so it is more organized. 
    I did have an issue with the background image but was able to fix it to have it properly shown. I am unsure if it was the convetional way of doing it but it is running when deployed into the webpage.
    The application does run, each hovered button sends the user to the appropriate description in the page.
